# Overview

This is a simple SQL Database program that uses the sqlite3 module. I created this to give an example of how to use sqlite3 in python and create a database that is stored via text file. I created my own example of what a database might look like for a small video game store. In the program I am able to create tables, populate data, and manipulate through that data with SQL queries.

# Relational Database

The relational database I am using is called sqlite3. It is different than most databases out there, because it is an embedded, file-based database. It is already built into python, so there is no installation that is required before using it. Within the database, I created three separate tables. One table stores the information for each game they have in the store, another stores information for every customer they may have in the future, and another stores information for all the orders that come through the store.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.10.4 64 bit
* Git / GitHub
* sqlite3

# Future Work

- Add more tables to the database
- Add update and delete statements to other tables
- Update the software to add more user interaction
